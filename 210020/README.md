# How I proceded in this task
First of all install the gym and the pygame packages using command promt or terminal.           
Then create an environment and import the cartpole model.                 
I ran it 400 times. I adjusted coefficient of P,I,D to get the best stability.             
We are also applying force which is shown as form of code.                
After all iterations(400) are over the loop terminates.
